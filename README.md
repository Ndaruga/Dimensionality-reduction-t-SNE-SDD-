# Dimensionality reduction On Gene expression cancer RNA-Sequence


### Algorithms
#### T-distribution Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and Same Degree Distribution(SDD)
This collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

### What is t-SNE?
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised, non-linear technique primarily used for data exploration and visualizing high-dimensional data. In simpler terms, t-SNE gives you a feel or intuition of how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space. It was developed by Laurens van der Maatens and Geoffrey Hinton in 2008.
